# PentestLiveTargets
Week 8: Three versions of the Globitek website are available to you. They are mostly identical. However, each one has been given a different color menu bar—blue, green, red—and each one has been given two different security vulnerabilities. The goal is to identify which two vulnerabilities blue has, which two vulnerabilities green has, and which two vulnerabilities red has.
